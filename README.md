# Elastic Bitcoin Interface

This is front-end repository of the [Elastic Bitcoin](https://elasticbtc.fi/).

## üíª Set Up Environment

To begin, you need to install dependencies with Yarn.

```
 $ yarn
```

You should update **default provider URL** because our production provider URL is limited by CORS for security.
On `src/config.ts`, please replace it:

```diff
- defaultProvider: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/OLD_PROVIDER_URL',
+ defaultProvider: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROVIDER_URL',
```

After it, you can launch the development server with following command.

```
 $ yarn start
```

## üë©‚Äçüåæ If You Want to Bring Your Own Contract...

If you want to use different contract deployment on development,
please build [elasticbtc-protocol](https://github.com/elasticbtc/elasticbtc-protocol) and copy-n-paste
the deployment information generated on `build/deployment.<network>.json` into this project's deployment directory,
which is `src/basis-cash/deployments`.

Then, you need to change the deployment reference into yours. Suppose that the new deployment file is named `deployments.local.json`:

```diff
- deployments: require('./basis-cash/deployments/deployments.mainnet.json'),
+ deployments: require('./basis-cash/deployments/deployments.local.json'),
```
